Ionide is an organization which builds **high quality, cross platform developer tools for F#**. Our flag project is Ionide-VSCode - a Visual Studio Code plugin, with more than 1 millions downloads, transforming VSCode into **fully-fledged F# IDE**. But Ionide is more then just editor plugin - we build whole ecosystem of developers tools - from [documentation generator](Tools/fornax.html), through [F# LSP server](Tools/fsac.html), to experimental and innovative projects like [F# Analyzers](Libraries/fsanalyzers.html)
