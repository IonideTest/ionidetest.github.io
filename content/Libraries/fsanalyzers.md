`FSharp.Analyzers.SDK` is a library used for building custom analyzers for FSAC / F# editors. F# analyzers are live, real-time, project-based plugins that enables diagnosis of source code and surfacing of custom errors, warnings and code fixes into the editor. They're heavily influenced and inspired by [Roslyn Analyzers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/code-quality/roslyn-analyzers-overview?view=vs-2019).
