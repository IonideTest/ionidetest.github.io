# Call to Action

## How to contribute

*Imposter syndrome disclaimer*: I want your help. No really, I do.

There might be a little voice inside that tells you you're not ready; that you need to do one more tutorial, or learn another framework, or write a few more blog posts before you can help me with this project.

I assure you, that's not the case.

All Ionide projects have some clear Contribution Guidelines and expectations that you can find in every repo - [example here](https://github.com/ionide/ionide-vscode-fsharp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

The contribution guidelines outline the process that you'll need to follow to get a patch merged. By making expectations and processes explicit, I hope it will make it easier for you to contribute.

And you don't just have to write code. You can help out by writing documentation, tests, or even by giving feedback about this work. (And yes, that includes giving feedback about the contribution guidelines.)

Thank you for contributing!
